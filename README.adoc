For the application to work correctly, you need:

1. Visit https://datasets.imdbws.com/
2. Download archives, unzip .tsv files and rename them:
   * name.basics.tsv.gz -> people.tsv
   * title.basics.tsv.gz -> movies.tsv
   * title.ratings.tsv.gz -> ratings.tsv
   * title.principals.tsv.gz -> roles.tsv
3. Create "**datasets**" directory in root project directory and paste four .tsv files.
4. Run project:
   *  First of all install on PC docker, kubernetes and minikube
   *  Launch file "app-init.sh" from console ( bash ./app-init.sh )
   *  Make sure all pods are working and get an IP address minikube
   *  Add the following line to the bottom of the /etc/hosts file on your computer (you will need administrator access)‚ùó
